# 3D Reconstruction
- Implemented a linear algorithm which could recover 2D robot poses and landmark positions with bearing-only measurements. With Reference to [Linear 2D Localization and Mapping for Single and Multiple Robot Scenarios]
- Currently working on transforming the linear 2D Localization and Mapping algorithm to 3D using vertical line detection
